- Implementation of a three dimensional grid
- Interactions should be read in through a file looking like

#i  j   k   J_ijk
1   0   0   1.0
0   1   0   3.0
0   0   1   2.0
-1  0   0   1.0
0   -1  0   3.0
0   0   -1  2.0

This file will be material specific and allows the solving of LLG for complex real life materials.
